A conditional ((Symbol)), constraining the characters that can immediately precede a symbol in the input source text.

#### Syntax

*  `constraint << Symbol` 
*  `constraint !<< Symbol`


where a _constraint_ is any character class, a literal or a keyword non-terminal ((SyntaxDefinition-Symbol)).

#### Types

#### Description

Using `!<<`, the parser will not accept the _Symbol_ if it is immediately preceded by the _terminal_ in the input string. If the start of the symbol coincides with start of the inout, the constraint will always succeed and the symbol is accepted.
