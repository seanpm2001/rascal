Ambiguity detection helps to find ambiguities in syntax definitions.

#### Syntax

#### Types

#### Function

#### Description

AmbiDexter is a tool that analyzes ((Syntax Definition))s, including their ((Disambiguation))s, to try and determine which ambiguities it contains. 
Static detection of ambiguity is not decidable, nevertheless AmbiDexter does a fine job at finding them. 


#### Examples

#### Benefits

*  AmbiDexter can find ambiguity for you before testing the parser, after which you can use ((AmbiguityDiagnosis)) to explain it. 

#### Pitfalls

*  AmbiDexter is now a separate command-line tool which still needs integration
*  AmbiDexter is not a silver bullet. It has a time-limit to stop after having searcher only so much of a language. After the time limit has expired, your ((SyntaxDefinition)) may still be ambiguous.
