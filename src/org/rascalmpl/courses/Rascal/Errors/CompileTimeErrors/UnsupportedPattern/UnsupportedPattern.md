#### Usage

#### Description

This is a case where the syntax (parser) of Rascal allows some kind of pattern, while the semantics (interpreter) does not support it (yet).
To solve this issue, usually you can introduce a variable in the place of the not support pattern, and check conditions on the value "manually" later.
