#### Description

Subscription is available for values of various types including: 
[string]((Rascal:String-Subscription)), 
[node]((Rascal:Node-Subscription)),
[list]((Rascal:List-Subscription)), 
[map]((Rascal:Map-Subscription)), 
[tuple]((Rascal:Tuple-Subscription)) and 
[relation]((Rascal:Relation-Subscription)).

of indices that are used.

[1,2,3][2,1];
("a":1, "b":2, "c":3)["c", "d"];
<1, 2, 3>[5,6];
```
