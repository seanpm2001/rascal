#### Synopsis

All errors that can occur during compilation of a Rascal program.

#### Description

WARNING: in progress of being adopted to the Rascal compiler. This list currently holds 
for the Rascal interpreter.

The following compile time (static) errors can occur in a Rascal program. 
They cannot be caught by the Rascal program. Although some of these errors are raised while running
Rascal programs in the interpreter, they are all intended to be raised by a static checker. This static
checker is currently under development.
