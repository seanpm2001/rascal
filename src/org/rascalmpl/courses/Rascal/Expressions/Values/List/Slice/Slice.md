#### Synopsis

Retrieve a slice of a list.

#### Syntax

*  `Exp~1~ [ Exp~2~ .. Exp~4~]`
*  `Exp~1~ [ Exp~2~ , Exp~3~ .. Exp~4~]`


where _Exp_~2~ and _Exp_~4~ are optional.

#### Types

//


| `Exp~1~`     | `Exp~2~` |  `Exp~3~`  | `Exp~4~` | `Exp~1~ [ Exp~2~ .. Exp~4~ ]`   or  `Exp~1~ [ Exp~2~ , Exp~3~ .. Exp~4~]`  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list[T~1~]` | `int`     | `int`       | `int`     |  `list[T~1~]`                                                                 |


#### Function

#### Description

List slicing uses the integer values of _Exp_~2~ and _Exp_~4~ to determine the `begin` (*inclusive*) and `end` (*exclusive*)
of a slice from the list value _L_ of _Exp_~1~. Negative indices count from the end of the list backwards.
Using the second form, an extra index _Exp_~3~ is given that determines the
index of the second element in the slice and establishes the `step` between
successive elements in the slice. The default `step` is 1.
If `end` is smaller than `begin`, the slice is constructed backwards.

Let `Len` be the length of _L_ and let _N_~2~, _N_~3~ and _N_~4~ be the respective values of the expressions
 _Exp_~2~, _Exp_~2~ and _Exp_~2~ when they are present.

The slice parameters `begin`, `end`, and `step` are determined as follows:

*  _Exp~2~_:
**  If _Exp~2~_ is absent, then `begin = 0`.
**  Otherwise, if _N~2~_ >= 0 then `begin = N~2~` else `begin = N~2~ + Len`. 
*  _Exp~4~_:
**  If _Exp~4~_ is absent, then `end = Len`.
**  Otherwise, if _N~4~_ >= 0, then `end = N~4~` else `end = N~4~ + Len`.
*  _Exp~3~_:
**  If _Exp~3~_ is absent, then if `begin < end` then `step = 1` else `step = -1`.
**  Otherwise, if `begin < end`, then `step = N~3~ - begin` else `step = begin - N~3~`.


Now, the constraints `0 <= begin < Len` and `0 < end < Len` should hold,
otherwise the exception `IndexOutOfBounds` is thrown.

The slice consists of the elements `L[begin]`, `L[begin+step]`, `L[end - step]`.
When `begin >= end`, the elements are listed in reverse order.

#### Examples

Consider the list `L = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80];` as running example.

Here is a view on _L_ that will help to correlate positive and negative indices:


|`i`        | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`L[i]`     | 0 | 10| 20| 30| 40| 50| 60| 70|80  |
|`-i`       | -9| -8| -7| -6| -5| -4| -3| -2| -1 |




Some common use cases (with `begin` <= `end`):


| Slice           | Means:                                                      |
| --- | --- |
| `L[begin..end]` | elements with indices `begin` through `end-1`               |
| `L[begin..]`    | elements with indices `begin` through the rest of the list  |
| `L[..end]`      | elements with indices from the beginning through `end-1`    |
| `L[..]`         | the whole list                                              |
| `L[-1]`         | last element of the list                                    |
| `L[-2..]`       | the last two elements of the list                           |
| `L[..-2]`       | all elements except the last two.                           |



Let's put this into practice now.

```rascal-shell,error
L = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80];
```
Slices with begin < end
```rascal-shell,continue,error
L[1..3];
L[1..];       // empty end => end of list
L[..3];       // empty begin => first element of list
L[..];        // both empty => whole list
```
Slices with  begin >= end
```rascal-shell,continue,error
L[3..1];      // slice contains elements with indices 3 and 2 (in that order)
L[3..3];      // empty slice when begin == end
```
Slices with negative begin or end:
```rascal-shell,continue,error
L[2..-2];     // equivalent to L[2..7]
L[2..7];
L[-4..-2];    // equivalent to L[5..7]
L[5..7];
```
Slices with an explicit second index:
```rascal-shell,continue,error
L[1,3..6];
L[5,3..];
```
Explore error cases:
```rascal-shell,continue,error
L[..10];
L[1..20];
```
