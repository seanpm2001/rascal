#### Function

#### Description

The `+` operator can insert an element in front of a list. Note that `+` is one of the ((Operators)) that is overloaded, it is also ((List-Concatenation)) and ((List-Append)) for example.

#### Examples

```rascal-shell
1 + []
1 + [2]
1 + [2,3]
```

#### Benefits

#### Pitfalls

*  If the first operand before the `+` is a list, `+` acts as ((List-Concatenation)) and not as ((List-Insert))

This is concatenation:
```rascal-shell,continue
[1] + [2]
```
To insert a list as an element, use extra brackets:
```rascal-shell,continue
[[1]] + [2]
```
