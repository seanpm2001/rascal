#### Function

#### Description

Comparison on nodes is defined by a lexicographic ordering. Node `N = F(N~1~, ..., N~n~)` is less than node 
`N = G(M~1~, ..., M~m~)` when:
*  _N_ is not equal to _M_, and
*  _F_ is lexicographically less than _G_, or _F_ is equal to _G_ and `n < m`.

#### Examples

```rascal-shell
"f"(10, "abc") < "g"(3);
"f"(10) < "f"(10, "abc");
```
