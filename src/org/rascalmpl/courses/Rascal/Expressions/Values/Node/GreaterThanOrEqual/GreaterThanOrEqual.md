#### Function

#### Description

Comparison on nodes is defined by a lexicographic ordering. Node `N = F(N~1~, ..., N~n~)` is greater than or equal node 
`N = G(M~1~, ..., M~m~)` when:
*  _N_ is equal to _M_, or
*  _F_ is lexicographically greater than _G_, or _F_ is equal to _G_ and `n > m`.

#### Examples

```rascal-shell
"g"(3) >= "f"(10, "abc");
"f"(10, "abc") >= "f"(10);
"f"(10, "abc") >= "f"(10, "abc");
```
