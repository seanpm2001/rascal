#### Description

String subscription uses the integer value of _Exp_~2~ as index in the string value of _Exp_~1~.
The value of _Exp_~2~ should be greater or equal 0 and less than the number of characters in the string.
If this is not the case, the exception `IndexOutOfBounds` is thrown.

#### Examples

Introduce a string, assign it to S and retrieve the element with index 1:
```rascal-shell,continue,error
S = "abc";
S[1];
```
Explore an error case:
```rascal-shell,continue,error
S[5];
```
