#### Description

Map subscription uses the value of _Exp_~2~ as key in the map value of _Exp_~1~ and returns the associated value.
If this key does not occur in the map, the exception `NoSuchKey` is thrown.

#### Examples

```rascal-shell,error
```
Introduce a map, assign it to `colors`, and retrieve the element with index `"trumps"`:
```rascal-shell,continue,error
colors = ("hearts":"red", "clover":"black", 
          "trumps":"black", "clubs":"red");
colors["trumps"];
```

```rascal-shell,continue,error
colors[0];
colors["square"];
